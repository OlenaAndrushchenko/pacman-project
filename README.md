3. **Center Pacman on the Screen**: The `index.html` file should display a 100x100 pixel Pacman image centered on the screen.

This exercise will be developed incrementally, with requirements subject to change. Remember, perfection is not expected on the first attempt, and iterative improvement is part of the process.
